you can make use of the Blip2 model, which is a more powerful pre-trained model for image captioning. 
In fact, you can easily incorporate any new pre-trained model that becomes available, as they are 
continuously developed to be more powerful. In the example below, we demonstrate the usage of the Blip2 
model. However, please be aware that the Blip2 model requires 10GB of space.
